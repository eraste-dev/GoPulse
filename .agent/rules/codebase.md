Shadowy woodland tones conveying silence, stability, and understated sophistication.

Black Forest — #04471C
Deep, near-black green evoking dense forests, mystery, and raw strength.

Sea Green — #058C42
Rich organic green expressing resilience, balance, and natural harmony.

Malachite — #16DB65
Vibrant, energetic green symbolizing freshness, growth, and vitality.

2. Adopt a minimalist UI/UX approach
Use as few colors as possible. Apply color only to action buttons, highlights, or elements where visual emphasis is necessary. Prioritize clarity, hierarchy, and usability over decoration.
